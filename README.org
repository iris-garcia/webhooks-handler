* Description
GitHub allows to register [[https://developer.github.com/webhooks/][Webhooks]] for your repositories. Everytime an
[[https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/][Event]] occurs a call to the registered endpoint will be made with the
details of the Event.

This library is a handler for those Events, allowing the user to put
any logic for a given Event and react accordingly.

The choosen language is [[https://golang.org/][Go]] for different reasons, but the two main
ones are:
1. It is already used in many services and libraries.
2. It is a challenge for myself because as the time of writting I did
   never code in Go.

* Example
To be done.
